---1173. Immediate Food Delivery I
---1.write by myself, 不知道为啥报错se

select count(a)/count(b)
from 
(select delivery_id as a
from delivery 
where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) as t1
,
(select delivery_id as b
from delivery) as t2

---第一个因为两个子句cross了，所以第一个是2行，第一个是6行，就变成了12行，a,b都是 delivery_id,相当于a等于b都是12，所以计算出的结果就是1
---写成下面就对了
select round(100*a/b,2) as immediate_percentage 
from 
(select count(delivery_id) as a from delivery where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) as t1
,
(select count(delivery_id) as b from delivery) as t2

---2.write by myself ,不知道为啥报错。
(select count(delivery_id)
from delivery 
where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
/
(select count(delivery_id)
from delivery)
---第二个，要加个select 在最开始的位置，否则是两个数相除得到一个数，并没有select 出来，所以报错了。 改撑下面这样就对了
select(round(
    
(select count(delivery_id) from delivery where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
/
(select count(delivery_id) from delivery) * 100
,2)
) 
as immediate_percentage

---solution
select round(sum(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end )/count(delivery_id)*100,2) as immediate_percentage  
from delivery
