181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

---write by myself, first try used distinct e1.name, can run, but failed to submit, then use only e1.name , 
---then can submit successful, it should because of the name, for example, it has name like 'y' and 'Y',
--- distinct will consider them as the same name, but they are different in this case
--- I tried select 'y' != 'Y', it gave the output 0, and tried select 'y' = 'Y', it gave the output 1

select e1.name as employee
from employee e1
join employee e2 on e1. managerid = e2.id and e1.salary > e2.salary
