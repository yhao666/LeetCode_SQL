---第一次没写t2报错了，要注意有没有repeat 的 学生和课程记录。

--- 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate
----我下面自己写的答案错了， 因为，count(*)之后，再在主语句里sum，最后还是sum了重复的，并没有去重复，白distinct了。
select round(ifnull(sum(A.cnt1)/sum(B.cnt2),0),2) as accept_rate
from
(select distinct requester_id,accepter_id,count(*) as cnt1 from request_accepted group by 1,2) as A
,(select distinct sender_id,send_to_id, count(*) as cnt2 from friend_request group by 1,2) as B

---跟着参考答案重写的
select
round(
    ifnull(
    (select count(*) from (select distinct requester_id, accepter_id from request_accepted) as t1) 
    /
    (select count(*) from (select distinct sender_id, send_to_id from friend_request) as t2),0)

---603. Consecutive Available Seats
---write by myself

select t1.seat_id 
from 
(select seat_id from cinema where free = 1) as t1 
join 
(select seat_id from cinema where free = 1) as t2
on t1.seat_id +1 = t2.seat_id
 
union

select t2.seat_id 
from 
(select seat_id from cinema where free = 1) as t1 
join 
(select seat_id from cinema where free = 1) as t2
on t1.seat_id +1 = t2.seat_id

order by seat_id ;

--- solution
select distinct a.seat_id
from cinema a join cinema b
  on abs(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1
  and a.free = true and b.free = true
order by a.seat_id

from salesperson sp
join orders ods on sp.sales_id = ods.sales_id
join company cp on ods.com_id = cp.com_id and ods.com_id=1 where cp.name = 'RED') 

---上面的改成下面就work了， 不能用ods.com_id =1 不知道为什么。
select distinct name
from salesperson
where name not in
