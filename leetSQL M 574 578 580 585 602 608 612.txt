---mysql from solution, in  后面只能有一个字段，所以如果写 in (select tiv_2015, count(*) from .......会报错 Operand should contain 1 column(s)

from insurance
where tiv_2015 in (select tiv_2015 from insurance group by tiv_2015 having count(*)>1)
and (lat,lon) in (select lat,lon from insurance group by lat,lon having count(*) = 1)
